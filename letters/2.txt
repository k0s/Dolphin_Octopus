My dear friend, an Octopus,

I write you from warm and sunny waters: the reception pools of the Grand
Holosonibibliotechnicolliseum of Atlantis, where I just heard the most
awe inspiring historical opera. It concerned one of the great dramas of
human history: Cleopatra, queen of the Egyptians, and her brief affair
with Julius Caesar, the first great emporer of Rome. If only you had the
ears to hear what I just heard, or the mammalian nervous system to feel
the intensity of their passion.

There is more than literally a great deal of water between us. I am grateful
for your correspondence, as for so long our races have had diverging views.
As we discussed at the conference, global circumstances press upon dolphin
and octopus to overcome our differences and bring a new harmony to the oceans.
Your astute suggestion that we approach such reconciliation by a discussion
of history was very well taken.

But I find your opening remarks difficult to follow. You say that the humans poisoned
your home. Our home? We have no record of this in any of our official hymnals.
Was it not the Demiurge Mechanos that poisoned the land before it slew the last human
in Ragnarok?

I know the climate doesn't suit you. But I do wish you could come an visit Atlantis.
We might find some way of sharing our records with you. Close captioning perhaps.

Salutations,

Thaumus Anastasius
